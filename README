# Testing datasets
# The reference sequence was generate by ucsc.hg19.fasta
# 
# Mitochondrial chromosome only:

head -n 333 /home/hpc/cychen/user/dungchi/TaiwanBiobank/t1000g/ucsc.hg19.fasta > test.fa

#
# The example reads are downloaded from:
# https://bioinf.comav.upv.es/courses/sequence_analysis/final_practice.html
#
# We have recived 20000 human mithocondrial reads from a yoruba individual.

# Link: https://bioinf.comav.upv.es/courses/sequence_analysis/_downloads/mito_yoruba_reads_pe.20k.fastq.gz
#
# The reads are Illumina paired end and we want to assemble them:

wget https://bioinf.comav.upv.es/courses/sequence_analysis/_downloads/mito_yoruba_reads_pe.20k.fastq.gz --no-check-certificate

# Extract the file

gunzip -c mito_yoruba_reads_pe.20k.fastq.gz  > test.fastq 

# Split one pair-end into two files

sga-deinterleave.pl test.fastq mito_yoruba.r1.fastq mito_yoruba.r2.fastq
